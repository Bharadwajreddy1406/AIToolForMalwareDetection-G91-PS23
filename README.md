Please be advised that this is a project undertaken by second-year students of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and is not intended as a comprehensive application; rather, it serves as an educational endeavour. Our efforts aim to provide practical experience and application of theoretical knowledge within the scope of our academic curriculum and research done till date. It is crucial to recognize that this project is primarily an educational exercise and may not attain the standards or functionality associated with a fully developed application. Your understanding of this educational focus is greatly appreciated.  

**Usage:** 

Our software serves as a robust tool for analysing network traffic, evaluating its safety, and identifying potential threats such as DDoS, SSH, Web attacks, BotNet, Infiltration, and Heartbleed. Upon system boot, the software initiates a packet sniffing phase for 60 seconds every ten minutes. The collected data is then processed through an API hosted on a complimentary server. 

Please be aware that the analysis may require some time, as our software is provided free of charge and relies on a free server for hosting. 

The real-time analysis of 60 seconds every 10 minutes can be stopped by simply clicking on “Stop real-time analysis” 

In addition to its primary network analysis capabilities, our software includes an advanced feature designed to detect newly connected external drives. Upon detecting a new external drive, users will receive a notification prompting them to either initiate a scan or skip the scanning process. This feature encourages users to exercise caution when interacting with files on the detected external drive, ensuring a thorough assessment of its safety status. It serves as a proactive measure to identify and address potential security concerns associated with external drives deemed "potentially" unsafe. 

As for now this has only been developed for WINDOWS systems only.

Here we will talk about the brief understanding                                                                                       of how the software works and all the modules/                                                                       dependencies used to build the software.

returning a list of Packet objects which are then save to a file in the libpcap format, hence converting the List of Packet Objects to a pcap file. The pcap file is then analyzed by CICFlowMeter, mainly for feature extraction. It reads pcap files containing captured network traffic; for each packet, it analyzes the source and destination addresses, creating bidirectional flows (bi-flows) representing the communication between two endpoints.  

CICFlowMeter creates unique “flow-key” for each bi-directional flow using the Source IP, Dest IP, Source Port, Dest Port, and Protocol. By analysing packets that have the same “flow key” are grouped together into the same bi-flow. This creates a continuous representation of the communication between two endpoints. Hence, to put it in simpler terms CICFlowMeter provides a higher-level view of network traffic as flows instead of a long list of packets.  

The CSV generated by CICFlowMeter, where each row represents a flow and each column is a different feature of the flow, is converted into a pandas DataFrame. Next, the columns which are not required are dropped and further the DataFrame is converted into a more usable format by replacing infinity values with 0, filling NaN values with 0, etc.  

Finally, the DataFrame goes through a loop where each flow(row) is analysed and predicted by a pre- trained model accordingly. 

We have used AdaBoost, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours
